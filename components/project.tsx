          Surfer Inu ($SURFINU), a highly deflationary token on the Ethereum Blockchain that never stops pumping through the use of true deflationary techniques and further income generation. 
          
          <br/> <br />Surfer Inu ($SURFINU) has a strong community at its core and is your ticket to wealth creation.

            <br/> <br />

            One of the main issues cryptocurrency projects face is the lack of longterm volume; which invariably slows down further development and any subsequent reinvestment into enhancing the project. 
            
            <br/> <br />Surfer Inu ($SURFINU) solves this by investing a percentage of the marketing wallet into yield bearing assets; with profits generated inherently reintroduced back into the project in the form of marketing, token buy backs etc. 
            
            <br/> <br />
            Thereby increasing the profile of the project and attracting new investors.
